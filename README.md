## About the Project
This study aimed to build a malware detector using CICMalmem datasets, which will be able to . Later on, we performed evasion attacks on the best-performing model and evaluated their performance. We collected the datasets named CIC-Malmem2022 for the open-access website of the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity
